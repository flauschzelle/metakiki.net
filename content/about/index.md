## Data protection

I don't collect any of your data on this website (EU law maybe requires that I let you know about this).

## Colophon

The contents of this site are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and compiled to HTML5 by [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws). I was inspired to do it that way by [blinry's website](https://blinry.org) and you can [read more about it over there](https://blinry.org/how-to-blog-with-nanoc/).

The fonts are [Noticia Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Noticia+Text), [<span style="font-family: OpenSans"><b>Open Sans</b></span>](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) and [`Ubuntu Mono`](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu+Mono).

## Support

You can buy me a (metaphorical) [coffee](https://ko-fi.com/metakiki) to help me maintain this website and my other projects. If you don't want to use Ko-fi, you can also ask me for other ways to leave me a tip.
