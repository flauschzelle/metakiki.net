This t-shirt was inspired by a cartoon that can be found online in different styles of art - usually some kind of stick figure human saying those two sentences to another human.

I&nbsp;created my own version with a cat, because everything is better with cute cats ;) I&nbsp;first made a sketch with pencil, then a digital version in Inkscape, and cut it out with the plotter in our local hackerspace, where I also pressed it onto the t-shirt.
