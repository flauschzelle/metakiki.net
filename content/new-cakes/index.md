Today, I learned how to build Twitter bots with [Tracery](http://tracery.io/). My first creation is [**@new_cakes**](https://twitter.com/new_cakes) - Your friendly neighborhood pastry chef's newest creations ;) It tweets random, yummy-sounding names of sweet pastries. Be inspired and enjoy your cake!

No matter if you prefer cupcakes...

... or pie ...

... whenever you don't know what to bake, **New Cakes** can give you lots of inspiration :)
